# HelianthusVariants_smp_metadata

This repo is a compliation of three machine learning simulators: smc++, discoal, and diploSHIC

All are run through a cluster through FARM, provided by the University of California, Davis

There is an md file for each step by step tutorial on how to run each simulation (eventually pictures to show output)
